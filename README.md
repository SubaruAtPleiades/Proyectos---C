# C---Projects

**My C Programming Projects**

Welcome to my collection of projects developed in the C programming language. These projects reflect my journey through learning computer science fundamentals and algorithm development with C. Each project showcases different challenges and concepts I've encountered and provides evidence of my ability to write efficient, logical, and readable code.

**Projects Included**

Scramble Code Distributable
This project includes a distributable codebase for the Scramble game. It's designed with modularization in mind to facilitate easy updates and collaborative development.

**The Fifteen Puzzle Game**

A digital take on the traditional sliding puzzle game, optimized for smooth gameplay experience and user interaction.

**Password Cracker with Salt**

A security-driven program that breaks hashed passwords given the salt. This project allowed me to dive deep into cryptographic practices and understand the importance of data security.

**Caesar Cipher**

An implementation of the Caesar cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages. This project served as a practical introduction to symmetric encryption and character string manipulation.

**Sorting Race**

An interactive demonstration comparing selection, insertion, and bubble sort algorithms. It visualizes the efficiency and runtime of each algorithm, providing a hands-on experience with computational complexity.

**Efficient Search and Sort in C**

This is an implementation of a sorting algorithm with O(nÂ²) time complexity and a search algorithm with O(log n) time complexity, optimized for handling large data sets.

**Advanced Command-Line Calculator (In Progress)**

A feature-rich calculator operated through the command line that currently supports basic arithmetic operations and modular arithmetic, with plans to incorporate trigonometric functions and extended precision using the MPFR library.

**Future Work**

I am actively working on enhancing the command-line calculator to include additional mathematical operations and improve its numerical precision. Stay tuned for updates!

**Installation and Usage**

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a separate project. Navigate to the directory of the project you're interested in, and you'll find specific instructions for compiling and running the program in the README file within that directory.

**Contributing**

I am always looking to improve my projects and welcome any feedback or contributions. If you have suggestions or want to contribute, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.

**License**

This repository is open-sourced under the MIT license.
